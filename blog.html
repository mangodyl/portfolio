                    The Horror of Learning:
                 </h5>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    All of you reading will understand what it's like to try learning something new, whether it be coding or another matter. 
                    It's a universally shared experience, even if each person experiences it in a different way, as humans are the ultimate in learning dependency. 
                    There are no instincts when it comes to things like surfing the internet, or using computers to build a platform where one can try and quell
                    a crisis by writing a blog post. These actions are learned over the course of thousands of experiences. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    Even common sense is just an ability to assess, developed by learnings that the brain then draws upon to come to a conclusion like "mmm, I feel 
                    like I shouldn't read Pet Semetary after midnight when I have to get up early the next day". You haven't done it before, but you can bet that your boss 
                    doesn't believe in undead cats, and if you come into work looking like sh*t and sleep at your desk until lunchtime there'll be trouble.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    This is thanks to all you've learned over the course of your life. Your work values presentability, and Stephen King books (while fantastic) are 
                    make for sleepless nights.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    Essentially, humans are professional and relentless students, and yet I'm still having trouble with GraphQL.

                    Info Overload from the Info Overlords:
                </h5>
                
                <p class="blog-text">
                    Some of you, like me, will know the harsh taste of <em>"I can do better"</em> or <em>"I'm not happy with it yet"</em> when it comes to learning. 
                    Coding, however, has brought a new flavour to the mix:  <em>"How the hell am I meant to learn all this?"</em>
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    The world of computer programming is so chock-full of information that it can be really hard to learn despite all our practice. This feeling has only 
                    intensified recently, as when trying to learn GraphQL. The actual tech makes a lot of sense; creating schemas & resolvers, and making queries to 
                    get responses back with the same structure (no under/over-fetching of data). It's super useful stuff, and it's not super hard to understand, but for 
                    some reason learning GraphQL (or should I say, it's implementation) is just a struggle.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    I'm trying to learn this new tech while also having to look up a load of related things where I have gaps in my knowledge. It's to be expected of 
                    course, as I have only been coding for about 4-5 months now, but I feel that so many unexplored topics feel the same. It's often a Catch-22 of having to know one 
                    thing to learn the other, or you don't know how to leverage your current knowledge into this particular case.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    I'm currently trying to follow a fantastic <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/getting-started-github-graphql-api/">tutorial by Robin Wieruch</a> on how to use 
                    GraphQL with React. I've already gone through his series on a <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/graphql-apollo-server-tutorial/">backend look at GraphQL with Node, Express, and Apollo</a>, 
                    so I'm not completely lost, but as I start threading things in with React, I keep asking myself how I'm going to be able to fly solo.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    I have a project that I'm planning currently and I'm testing the waters of using GQL and React. How do I use what I know and the things I've covered in 
                    the tutorials for my own projects, with different requirements and purposes?
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    I guess it's something that I'll learn, just like everything else.
                </p>

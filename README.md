Professional Portfolio

A complete rehaul of my previous portfolio. I figured after I had learnt so much since the last time, I may as well start from the beginning this time round, and work mobile-first to ensure I didn't face the same issues as last time. 

Will continue to work on this as my knowledge progresses.

Shouldn't need to start from scratch again (thankfully) as my code is much easier to work with this time round.

Things to add:
- Update continuously with new projects.
- Contact form sends email (revisit after node lessons).
- Minor revisions (maybe more media breakpoints) to ensure not just the common screen sizes are covered.
- More interactivity?
- Improve general sleekness.
